# Tree_Species_Classification
Developing a Neural Network for Tree Species Classification in University Garden 
This report details the development and implementation of a neural network for tree species classification within the university garden. This assignment focused on three specific tree species Piper nigrum, Piper betle Linn and Piper longum that are very difficult to identify visually. By leveraging the power of machine learning, we aimed to create a more objective and automated approach for classifying these challenging tree species.
